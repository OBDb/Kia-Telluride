    description: "The first-generation Kia Telluride launched as the brand's flagship three-row midsize SUV, making a strong impression with its bold, boxy design and upscale appearance. Powered by a 3.8L naturally aspirated V6 engine producing 291 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and available active on-demand all-wheel drive. The spacious interior accommodated up to eight passengers across three rows, with notable features including available premium Nappa leather, 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Harman Kardon audio, and heated/ventilated first and second-row seats. The Telluride offered comprehensive safety technology including standard forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, and available blind-spot monitoring. Despite being Kia's first entry into the highly competitive three-row midsize SUV segment, the Telluride quickly became a sales success and earned numerous industry awards including the prestigious 2020 World Car of the Year and North American SUV of the Year. The first-generation Telluride established a reputation for offering near-luxury features and design at mainstream pricing, setting a new standard for the brand and segment."
